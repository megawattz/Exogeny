Finish web pages explaining

Use chat GPT to resolve issues.

Have chatGPT API generate planet histories.

Standalone Moralis Server (Moralis Repo)

3D star chart

Grid showing the various weights and probabilities involved with gameplay (how does life form influence popluation, how does atmosphere influence tech levels, etc etc.)

As tech levels rise particular skills are gained, represented by little icons like "coinage" "fire" "air travel" "nuclear power" "democracy"

As skills exceed or lag the average, negative events become more likely, like, if engineering starts to exceed science,
building collapse, if biology exceeds social sciences, biological warfare erupts.

Collections. Release the planets in batches called collections.

Alien alphabet for some things???? :)

Push the COLLECTIBLES aspect: sets

GNFTs Game NFTs

Also generated is something to actually push.

Think in phases.

OpenSea or other sites may already have a collection display area.

Need a way to send messages to a user (into their database record). It needs to display them, use them for chat and email
some to the user or SMS announcements about their planets.  "Civil War on Excalibur! Scientist invents electricity! etc
etc." A popup window with a link in the navbar that blinks if they have pending messages would be great but there may be
a better way.

Sets. Sell initial sets of planets, Alpha Centauri and it's sister stars.

Alarm when an event comes into (any planet)

Information scrolls across screen based on tech level. Decision points come up with owner having to make a choice. i.e. "Civil War, which side do you support?"

Planet culture has a "stability" value, which is the probability of collapse every turn. Various factors influence the stability

Click another menu option and a page comes up with selections on how to interact with the planet.

Click another menu option and 'history' of the planet comes up (significant events and production totals)

Use real stars and galactic coordinates (where applicable) so trade routes can have value

Factor matrix: N-dimensional array showing how each factor of culture, various techs, and lifeforms interact to trigger events and produce Tritanium-44

Auction House

Establish trade routes

Value of non-Tritanium assets for planets with exotic lifeforms, for example, entertainment can be used to keep a
population from revolting so you can important entertainment from another planet to keep a slave planet from
revolting. Or knowledge can be imported from somewhere to speed up tech level rise.

Click another menu and there is a place you can sell your planet.

Auction House

To add value to the NFTs, make them collectible in sets. The more you have, the higher your Titanium-44 paying. For example
1) One planet of each and every life form
2) One planet of each and every life chemistry
3) All planets in a star system
etc etc.
