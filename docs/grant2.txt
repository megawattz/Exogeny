Grant Proposal: ExoPlaneteer—A Blockchain-Based Casual Gaming Ecosystem

Exoplanets are planets that exist outside the Earth's solar system. As of 2023, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, with missions like NASA’s Kepler and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) contributing significantly to this field of astronomy. This game attempts to engage the audience that has interest in this, letting people imagine being in charge of an entire planet, an Exoplaneteer, from the beginnings of its civilization to its space age, having to deal with different intelligent life forms, types of civilzations and available resources on those planets.

Project Overview

Cryptocurrency is in need of broader real-world applications. While DeFi (Decentralized Finance) offers substantial use cases, its adoption is largely limited to niche audiences who are already familiar with token trading and yield farming. Despite its potential, DeFi risks stagnating, as the "game" of shuffling tokens for financial gains loses novelty. Similarly, other applications such as cross-border payments have a limited audience, and supply chain management remains a closed system largely restricted to corporate use. On-chain identity initiatives face public resistance due to privacy concerns. Gaming, however, presents a massive opportunity to expand cryptocurrency’s appeal.

Gaming is a multi-billion-dollar global industry with a user base that spans casual to competitive players. Cryptocurrency could revolutionize this space by enabling the transfer of in-game assets to real-world currencies. However, gamers have historically resisted pay-to-win models, where real-world money directly influences in-game advantages . This proposal aims to bridge the gap by offering a game in which players can earn real-world value through in-game actions, without the reverse. The result is a balanced, fair model where in-game achievements translate to rewards, but players are not penalized by others’ financial advantages.

ExoPlaneteer: A Blockchain-Based Game with Real-World Crypto Integration

ExoPlaneteer is a casual, NFT base game, where players buy, develop and trade planets across the galaxy. This is a blockchain-integrated game designed for individuals with busy lives. Players will manage NFT-based exoplanets, developing their civilizations and earning the in-game cryptocurrency, Tritanium-44 (Token Symbol T44), which can be converted standard on-chain ERC20 T44. Unlike traditional pay-to-win models, ExoPlaneteer ensures players cannot buy their way to success. The game's flow exclusively allows players to earn Tritanium-44 through active gameplay, fostering both fair competition and an engaging economic model. Note the emphasis is on NFTs, ownership and the artistic value with the added engagement of interacting with the NFT in a casual, easy to learn game. 

Gameplay Summary

Players own exoplanets, represented by NFTs, that evolve through in-game decisions. Civilization progress, resource management, and technology levels directly affect the generation of Tritanium-44. Players can trade planets on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and use Tritanium-44 to enhance their planetary assets. The game is a web page where every hour the player is presented with choices to make. There are no new keystrokes to learn, no complex web of skills and strategies that need to be learned to even start player. Just point and click when asked.

Real-World Application: Tritanium-44 is a standard ERC-20 cryptocurrency that players can earn through in-game achievements and then convert to other blockchain assets or currencies. The planets are ERC-1155 NFTs. All of these game elements fit into the standard EVM/ERC tools like NFT exchanges and DEXes.

Casual-Friendly: The game is designed to fit into the lives of busy individuals. Players interact with their planets through periodic decisions rather than long play sessions.

Dynamic NFTs: Planets are not static images but animated, unique NFTs with different resources, civilizations, and events.

Market Opportunity and Benefits to Blockchain

1. Standardizing the Game Asset Economy

Currently, there is a thriving but fragmented market for trading in-game assets, with third-party platforms such as PlayerAuctions and Traderie serving as underground exchanges . However, these platforms often violate game publishers' terms, risking players' accounts. Blockchain can legitimize this process by standardizing asset trading and providing a secure, transparent marketplace.

2. Fair Launch Economics

ExoPlaneteer ensures a "whale-proof" economy. Unlike games that allow early investors or large spenders to monopolize in-game resources, ExoPlaneteer rewards active management of assets. Neglecting a planet results in decreased productivity, encouraging ongoing engagement rather than passive wealth accumulation .

3. NFTs for Real Gamers
The gaming community has pushed back against NFTs, citing concerns over monetization . However, ExoPlaneteer addresses these concerns by designing an economy where real-world money cannot buy in-game success. Players earn rewards through skill and strategy rather than financial investment.

4. Expanding Crypto's Reach through Gaming
Gaming offers a much larger potential audience than existing DeFi and NFT applications. ExoPlaneteer will onboard casual gamers to cryptocurrency by introducing them to blockchain technology in a fun and accessible way .

Unique Selling Points

Blockchain-Integrated Economy: In-game progress translates into Tritanium-44, a cryptocurrency that can be traded on decentralized exchanges or used for in-game enhancements.

Casual and Accessible: The game is designed for individuals who cannot dedicate long hours to gameplay but want to experience the rewards of blockchain-based gaming.

Non-Pay-to-Win: Players cannot buy their way to victory; success is earned through strategic decision-making and active engagement.

Underserved Market: The game targets casual players who are interested in crypto, NFTs, and space-themed gaming.
Technological Integration

NFTs: Each exoplanet is an ERC-1155 NFT with distinct characteristics such as resources, civilization types, and environmental factors.

Tritanium-44: The in-game cryptocurrency is a real blockchain asset that players can convert into other cryptocurrencies. However, Tritanium-44 cannot be purchased directly—it must be earned through gameplay.

Multi-Chain Support: ExoPlaneteer is initially based on Ethereum's ERC-1155 standard but can be easily adapted for other blockchains like Solana.
Funding Request

We seek funding to support the following key areas:

Development: Completion of game mechanics, planetary NFTs, User Interface and blockchain integration.

Marketing: Community development campaigns targeting the cryptocurrency, NFT, and sci-fi gaming communities.

Expansion: Features like interplanetary trade, space infrastructure (space stations, space elevators etc), and real star maps.

Future Roadmap

Upgradable Planets: Players will have the option to enhance their planets visually, not just the planet stats.

Interplanetary Trade: Planets within the same solar system will trade instantly, while interstellar trade introduces delays, creating deeper strategic decision-making.

Real Star Map Integration: Players will manage planets within a galaxy mapped to real star systems, enhancing immersion and gameplay complexity.

Why Crypto Organizations Should Invest

ExoPlaneteer taps into a massive gaming market while solving core issues around asset monetization in a fair, player-first manner.
