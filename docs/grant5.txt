Grant Proposal: ExoPlaneteer—A Blockchain-Based Casual Gaming Ecosystem

Project Overview

Cryptocurrency needs a broader audience and real-world applications to speed up assimilation by Earthlings. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has demonstrated promise, but its impact is limited to niche audiences engaged in token trading and yield farming. These activities, while profitable for some, are ultimately self-contained and risk becoming repetitive and dull. Other blockchain applications—such as cross-border payments and supply chain management—have limited userbase, and have yet to fullful their true potential that cryptocurrencies need to sustain long-term growth. Most of the crypto applications to this point, while seemingly "easy" for techies, appear too complex for most people. Computer technologies are like that. They appear overwhelming until one tries it, then it's easy. Adding cryptocurrencies to computer games, would seem to be a powerful and easy channel for introducing people to cryptocurrencies and their benefit to them personally. 

Gaming is a $300 billion global industry with over 3 billion players worldwide. If even a small percentage interacted with the cryptocurrency network, it would provide the opportunity to demonstrate the advantage that a crypto enabled game has over the walled gardens that games are today, where the users are essentially locked into the game and all the years of gameplay they do ends up being wasted energy as far as netting any financial benefit for their lives. Yet, the gaming community has been resistant to blockchain technology due to its association with “pay-to-win” models, where real-world money, able to buy in-game assets, gives players advantages in games just because the player is real-work richer. ExoPlaneteer bridges this gap by offering a blockchain-integrated, fair-launch economy where players earn cryptocurrency through skill, strategy, and engagement—not through their wallets. It also prevents mass mining by automated methods because it requires decision making by a real person to generate Tritanium-44, the game's cryptocurrency.

ExoPlaneteer: A Blockchain-Based Game with Real-World Crypto Integration

ExoPlaneteer is a blockchain game where players manage NFT-based exoplanets, helping their civilizations grow and evolve. The game introduces Tritanium-44 (T44), an in-game cryptocurrency that players earn through thoughtful gameplay, and later convert into real-world assets. This innovative economic model ensures that in-game success is based on decisions and engagement, not financial investment. It’s a game designed for busy adults and casual gamers, enabling players to participate in the blockchain ecosystem without needing to invest long hours or make heavy financial commitments.

Gameplay Summary

Players buy exoplanets, NFTs on markets like OpenSea, that evolve based on the player’s decisions. Each planet has its own resources, civilization, and challenges. Players make decisions that affect the technological progress and population of their planet, which in turn affects the generation of T44. Planets can be traded on major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, and T44 can be used to enhance in-game assets or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. The NFTs are dual in nature, an animated video file of the planet as seen from space, and an image of the Dominant Indigenous Life Form that the player will be building the civilization with.

ExoPlaneteer allows players to:

Own NFT Planets: Each planet is an ERC-1155 NFT, with unique characteristics such as resources, environments, and civilizations.
Earn Tritanium-44: A real-world cryptocurrency generated in-game, with no pay-to-win mechanisms.
Develop Civilizations: Players can react to in-game events to increase their planet’s tech level, population, and T44 production.
Trade and Collect: Planets can be traded or collected to form powerful sets that multiply T44 generation, similar to card games like poker.
Why Crypto Companies Should Invest
ExoPlaneteer solves one of cryptocurrency’s biggest challenges: it offers a real-world application that engages a broad audience in a meaningful way. By funding ExoPlaneteer, crypto organizations can position themselves at the forefront of the play-to-earn revolution, gaining visibility in both the blockchain and gaming spaces.

Massive Market Potential: Gaming is a massive, thriving industry. Integrating crypto into games is the next logical step for mass adoption. ExoPlaneteer taps into casual gamers, a huge market largely ignored by current blockchain games.

Solving Crypto’s Image Problem: The backlash against NFTs in gaming has been driven by monetization models that prioritize corporate profits over player experience. ExoPlaneteer takes the opposite approach, focusing on player-driven success. By doing so, it offers an ethical, sustainable use for NFTs and blockchain technology.

Real Economic Use Case: T44 offers a unique opportunity to create a fair-launch cryptocurrency, free from the stigma of centralization or manipulation. By basing its value on gameplay and skill, T44 aligns with the principles of decentralization and fair economic systems.

Exoplaneteer Infrastructure

1) NFT ERC-1155 Contract which manages the NFTs, stored on IPFS and pinned with Pinata, one per blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB etc)
2) Token ERC-720 Contract, a fair launch contract with extensions to reward the player based on planet development.

These contracts are very simple, standard, and use the OpenZeppelin library which is battle tested and has as many bugs removed from it as any contracts out there.

3) Web Site which also runs the web based game application. This is a strategy game so low latency is not required and a web app is fast to implement.
4) MongoDB Database server to keep track of the game status

ERC-1155 NFTs: Each planet is a dynamic NFT with unique characteristics. ERC-1155 was chosen for its efficiency in managing multiple tokens and scalability.
Tritanium-44 (T44): A real-world cryptocurrency, T44 is earned through in-game progress and can be exchanged for other blockchain assets. It cannot be purchased or earned through financial investment, ensuring a fair-launch economy.
Multi-Chain Compatibility: While the initial deployment will be on Ethereum, ExoPlaneteer can easily be adapted to other chains like Solana or Polygon.

Technical Roadmap

The development of ExoPlaneteer will follow a multi-stage roadmap, ensuring that the game can be released in phases, each with its own blockchain functionality, while maintaining momentum and player interest. This phased approach also ensures that the game generates excitement and builds a community early on, without needing full feature completion to launch.

Stage 1: NFTs-Only Release
NFT Planets Released: The initial phase will involve the release of NFT planets on platforms like OpenSea. Players can purchase these planets, which will automatically generate 1 T44 per day. No additional functionality, such as enhancing or trading planets, will be included yet.  There is a "screensaver" application so the owner can put up a display of their planets and civilizations on a wall mounted television, or on their desktop computer or smartphone. 

Objective: Build community, onboard early adopters, and introduce the ExoPlaneteer universe through NFTs.

Stage 2: Planet Collecting and Tritanium-44 Multiplication

Planet Collections: Players can start collecting specific “sets” of planets, which will multiply the amount of T44 generated. For example, owning a matching set of planets from a single solar system will increase T44 production. These sets will be combinations of planets like Poker hands or Gin Rummy. The players can buy, sell and trade with each other to find the planets necessary to complete sets.

Objective: Drive engagement by rewarding strategic NFT collecting and introducing the first layer of gameplay mechanics.

Stage 3: Interactive Events and Civilization Management

Player Decisions: Planets will evolve based on events. Players will need to react to these events (such as natural disasters or technological breakthroughs) to improve their planets’ tech level and population. Poor decisions will result in a loss of resources or reduced T44 generation.

Objective: Deepen player interaction and increase engagement through decision-based gameplay that impacts NFT value, wins and losses that surprise the player and increase the agony and the ecstasy of game play.

Stage 4: Infrastructure Development and Specialization

Infrastructure Building: Players can invest T44 into building infrastructure, products, and services. Each planet will have categories for biological, engineering, social technology and other levels that allow for specific infrastructure upgrades.

Objective: Introduce long-term planning and reward players who strategically develop their planets.

Stage 5: Interplanetary Trade and Advanced Systems

Trade Routes: Planets will require trade with other planets to generate more advanced infrastructure and products. Players can form trade routes to exchange resources, with trade speed dictated by distance between planets. Planets within the same solar system will trade instantly, incentivizing the collection of entire systems.

Objective: Create a dynamic player-driven economy, encourage cooperation, and solidify ExoPlaneteer as a deeply strategic blockchain game.
Technological Integration

Stage 6: Player vs. Player

Letting those players who desire, enagage in warfare, subterfuge, deception to take planets and resources from other players through game play. This would be optional.

Objective: Appeal to those who need compeition against other humans to be entertained.

The name Exoplaneteer is only a working name and can be changed prior to release if marketing or trademark needs require it.

We look forward to your support in making ExoPlaneteer the flagship blockchain gaming project, setting a new standard for NFT and crypto integration in the gaming space.
