ExoPlaneteer Overview

ExoPlaneteer is a casual game for busy adults who cannot sit in front of screen playing games all day long.

The game play is simple: Played on a desktop, cellphone or tablet, the game is a small web application where players buy
one or more planet NFTs anytime they want. Each hour, events or opportunties will occur on the planet and the player can
respond to these with a simple yes or no or spending some planetary assets to influence the outcome of the opportunity:
Examples:

Your civilization is becoming totalitarian, spend money to counteract this trend?
fWriting is invented by a clever individual, do you want to help it spread or suppress it?

See the video showing the game play...

The reward for making correct decisions is to raise the technology level and population of the planet. The higher each
is, the more reward is given each hour. The reward is given in Tritanium-44 Planetary Treasury assets, which can later
be swapped for actual, on chain cryptocurrency whenever the player wants.

Each planet would have its own events and opportunities. The frequency and type of these opportunities is determined

Each planet has natural resources which can be combined with other resources to build infrastructure, goods and
services. Normally this will require trading with other players to aquire the necessary ingredients for more advanced
products.

Exchange contracts can be agreed upon between planets where each hour a set amount of resources and Tritanium-44 are
swapped in a continuous supply change.  The separate (in light years) between planets determines how long it takes fo
such goods to arrive. It is better to aquire multiple planets within the same solar system (same star) because
commerce between them is instant, no waiting.  

Online game involving buying, selling, and developing exoplanets and their civilizations to earn cryptocurrency. Each
planet is a set of a video file of the revolving planet, image of the dominant, indigenous, intelligent life form, and a
description of their culture and history. Planets are each onchain artwork NFTs that the player owns outright. He sell
the planet, develop the planet and engage in commerce with other planets to speed up development. The planets are
arranged by solar system and the manager. Planets earn a cryptocurrency based upon their population and technology
level. The game play consists of receiving hourly events and responding to them. The events represent points of
opportunity or crisis that the player must decide how to deal with.

This is not the game for hard core gamers, it's for casual players who cannot, or do not want to, sit in front of a
screen in all their free time. It's also probably 1/100th of the effort required for a full blown, immersion, space
shooter. This is more like buying and managing fictional, galactic real estate.

Planets are NFTs

Planets acquire crypto token Titanium-44

Planets actively acquire crypto and can be interacted with for entertainment

      Simple game for underserved market of consumers with disposable incomes who don't have time to sit in front of
computer playing games all day long. This offers a diversion and entertainment without monopolizing ones time .  Working

What makes ExoPlaneteer different?
    
ExoPlaneteer NFTs are animations, not just images. (See video on how planets are made)

ExoPlaneteer NFTs actually acquire crypto. They don't just sit there like Boring Apes

ExoPlaneteer NFTs can be improved and customized

ExoPlaneteer NFTs actively entertain and the player can feel a sense of ownership because of the work put into the planet

      Simple, easy to learn.

      Does not require full time participation to get rewarded

      Big rewards possible, ongoing, not only at time of resale

      Whale proof - Players must actively manage their planets or they lose technology, population and morale so
	there are only so many planets someone can own

      NFTs and Titanium-44 are game tokens, not currency. This may have beneficial tax treatment in the future. Is
	the IRS going to tax Magic Swords and Fictional Alien Planets? Are pre-school gamers going to be required to
	file yearly tax forms?

Game Play (See Video)

    
      Capture elements of simple games

      Higher tech level, population and moral increase Titanium-44 production

      Players can improve their planets by adding infrastructure like the all-time favorite game: Monopoly. Improved
      planets generate more Titanium-44.

      Very simple, players allocate Titanium-44 (the game token) towards different areas of technology growth of the
      planet

      Players can also collect sets of planets to increase Titanium-44 production like many card games (poker, gin rummy etc)
      Elements of chance so the game is not overly dependent on a chess level intellect

      Players allocate T44 towards tech or infrastructure, then at the top of the hour...

      ...the game calculates results, crediting crypto wallets with Titanium-44 and alerting players to significant

      events for their planet(s), by email or SMS if the player wants.
      Random events happen which can negatively or positively affect planet Titanium-44 production
      Initially P2E but PVP is coming as soon as play balance is achieved
      Important to preserve simplicity for new players and never overwhelm them with too much game detail until they
	are ready

      Rings - Like Saturn
      Irregular planets and moons (chunky asteroid appearance)
      Retrograde (backwards) orbits for moons
      Dark side city lights (once a planet's tech level achieves electricity)
      All cosmic object will be NFTs

    Planned
    
      Space Infrastructure like orbital rings, space stations, jhooks, space elevators, O'Neill cylinders etc.
      Planetary resources will be fungible tokenized (Industrial metals, precious metals etc)
      Asteroids and Comets
      Star Map where actual stars are incorporated into the game in their proper galactic coordinates, and thus where
	a planet's location matters for interstellar trade and relative cosmic environment stability (some parts of the
	galaxy are more likely to experience cosmic impacts, supernovae, dust obscuring starlight etc., all mostly bad
	stuff)
      Megastructures: Ring worlds, Dyson swarms, Stellasers, Stellar Engineering, Relocating Planets, Terraforming
      Production of finished goods from raw materials (requires vigorous play testing)
