Grant Proposal: ExoPlaneteer - An NFT Based Casual Gaming Ecosystem

Project Overview

Cryptocurrency needs a broader audience and real-world applications to speed up adoption. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has shown promise, but its impact is limited to niche audiences engaged in token trading and yield farming. These activities, while profitable for some, are ultimately self-contained and risk becoming repetitive and dull. Other blockchain applications—such as cross-border payments and supply chain management—have limited user bases and have yet to fulfill the potential that cryptocurrencies need to sustain long-term growth. Most crypto applications, while seemingly "easy" for techies, appear too complex for most people. Like many technologies, they seem overwhelming until people try them—then they realize they're easy. Adding cryptocurrencies to games would be a powerful and simple way to introduce people to cryptocurrencies and their personal benefits.

Gaming is an estimated $300 billion global industry with hundreds of millions of players worldwide. If even a small percentage interacted with the cryptocurrency networks, it would provide the opportunity to demonstrate the advantages a crypto-enabled game has over the walled gardens of today’s games. In traditional games, years of gameplay often provide no financial benefit to the player. The gaming community has been resistant to blockchain technology due to its association with “pay-to-win” models, where real-world money allows players to buy in-game assets, giving them an advantage. ExoPlaneteer bridges this gap by offering a blockchain-integrated, fair-launch economy where players earn cryptocurrency through skill, strategy, and engagement—not through their wallets. It also prevents automated mining, as it requires real decision-making to generate Tritanium-44 (T44), the game's cryptocurrency.

ExoPlaneteer: A Blockchain-Based Game with Real-World Crypto Integration

ExoPlaneteer is a blockchain game where players manage NFT-based exoplanets, helping their civilizations grow and evolve. The game introduces Tritanium-44 (T44), an in-game asset that players earn through thoughtful gameplay, and later cash-in for on-chain Tritanium-44. This innovative economic model ensures that in-game success is based on decisions and engagement, not financial investment. It’s a game designed for busy adults and casual gamers, allowing players to participate in the blockchain ecosystem without the need to invest long hours or make heavy financial commitments.

Exoplaneteer is actually 3 applications in one

1) An NFT art collection with facilities for displaying ones NFTs.
2) A casual game where players can imagine managing and entire world from stone age to space age.
3) A crypto currency mining application where players can generate real, on-chain tokens based upon skill in evolving their planet.

Gameplay Summary

Players buy exoplanets—NFTs available on marketplaces like OpenSea—that evolve based on player decisions. Each planet has its own resources, civilization, and challenges. Players make decisions that affect the technological progress and population of their planet, which in turn affects the generation of T44. Planets can be traded on major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, and T44 can be used to enhance in-game assets or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. The NFTs are dual in nature: they include an animated video file of the planet as seen from space, and an image of the Dominant Indigenous Life Form that the player will build the civilization with.

ExoPlaneteer allows players to:

Own NFT Planets: Each planet is an ERC-1155 NFT, with unique characteristics such as resources, environments, and civilizations. Owners can display their planets in a screensaver app.

Earn Tritanium-44: A real-world cryptocurrency generated in-game, with no pay-to-win mechanisms.

Develop Civilizations: Players can react to in-game events to increase their planet’s tech level, population, and T44 production.

Trade and Collect: Planets can be traded or collected to form powerful sets that multiply T44 generation, similar to card games like poker.
Why Crypto Companies Should Invest

ExoPlaneteer solves one of cryptocurrency’s biggest challenges: it offers a real-world application that engages a broad audience in a meaningful way. By funding ExoPlaneteer, crypto organizations can position themselves at the forefront of the play-to-earn revolution, gaining visibility in both the blockchain and gaming spaces.

Massive Market Potential: Gaming is a massive, thriving industry. Integrating crypto into games is the next logical step for mass adoption. ExoPlaneteer taps into casual gamers, a huge market largely ignored by current blockchain games.

Solving Crypto’s Image Problem: The backlash against NFTs in gaming has been driven by monetization models that prioritize corporate profits over player experience. ExoPlaneteer takes the opposite approach, focusing on player-driven success. By doing so, it offers an ethical, sustainable use for NFTs and blockchain technology.

Real Economic Use Case: T44 offers a unique opportunity to create a fair-launch cryptocurrency, free from the stigma of centralization or manipulation. By basing its value on gameplay and skill, T44 aligns with the principles of decentralization and fair economic systems.

Exoplaneteer Infrastructure

NFT ERC-1155 Contract: Manages the NFTs, stored on IPFS and pinned with Pinata, one per blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB, etc.).

Token ERC-720 Contract: A fair-launch contract with extensions to reward the player based on planet development. These contracts are standard, simple, and built using the OpenZeppelin library, which is battle-tested with extensive bug removal.

Web App: The game will be web-based, requiring minimal latency. As a strategy game, speed is less crucial, and a web app allows for fast implementation.

MongoDB Database: Tracks game status.

Technical Roadmap

The development of ExoPlaneteer will follow a multi-stage roadmap, ensuring that the game can be released in phases, each with its own blockchain functionality, while maintaining momentum and player interest. This phased approach also ensures that the game generates excitement and builds a community early on, without needing full feature completion to launch.

Stage 1: NFTs-Only Release

NFT Planets Released: Players can purchase planets, which will automatically generate 1 T44 per day. No additional functionality, such as enhancing or trading planets, will be included yet. A screensaver app will allow players to display their planets and civilizations on TVs, desktop computers, or smartphones.
Objective: Build community, onboard early adopters, and introduce the ExoPlaneteer universe through NFTs.

Stage 2: Planet Collecting and Tritanium-44 Multiplication
Planet Collections: Players can start collecting specific "sets" of planets, which will multiply the amount of T44 generated. For example, owning a matching set of planets from a single solar system will increase T44 production. These sets will be akin to poker hands or gin rummy. Players can buy, sell, and trade with each other to complete sets.
Objective: Drive engagement by rewarding strategic NFT collecting and introducing the first layer of gameplay mechanics.

Stage 3: Interactive Events and Civilization Management
Player Decisions: Planets will evolve based on events. Players will need to react to these events (such as natural disasters or technological breakthroughs) to improve their planets' tech levels and populations. Poor decisions will result in resource loss or reduced T44 generation.
Objective: Deepen player interaction and increase engagement through decision-based gameplay that impacts NFT value.

Stage 4: Infrastructure Development and Specialization
Infrastructure Building: Players can invest T44 into building infrastructure, products, and services. Each planet will have categories for biological, engineering, and social technology levels that allow for specific infrastructure upgrades.
Objective: Introduce long-term planning and reward players who strategically develop their planets.

Stage 5: Interplanetary Trade and Advanced Systems
Trade Routes: Planets will require trade with other planets to generate more advanced infrastructure and products. Players can form trade routes to exchange resources, with trade speed dictated by distance. Planets within the same solar system will trade instantly, incentivizing the collection of entire systems.
Objective: Create a dynamic, player-driven economy and solidify ExoPlaneteer as a deeply strategic blockchain game.

Stage 6: Player vs. Player
PvP Combat: Letting players engage in warfare, subterfuge, and deception to take planets and resources from others through gameplay. This would be optional for those who enjoy competition against other humans.
Objective: Appeal to competitive players who seek direct conflict and human challenges.

Technological Integration
ERC-1155 NFTs: Each planet is a dynamic NFT with unique characteristics, an animated, spinning planet video file and accompanying image file of the Dominant Indigenous Life Form of the planet.

Tritanium-44 (T44): A real-world cryptocurrency earned through in-game progress, which cannot be purchased or earned through financial investment, ensuring a fair-launch economy.
Multi-Chain Compatibility: While initially on Ethereum, ExoPlaneteer can be easily adapted to other chains like Solana or Polygon.

Finances and Tokenomics

We are assuming that the primary purpose for the grant is to have another application to make the blockchain involved more interesting and usable, and the grantors are not necessarily in investing in the game for returns. However, if that is the case, the profit from the game at first is derived from selling the planets, as art, on the NFT platforms. The game cryptocurrency is fair launched, staring from zero, no premined amount for the corporate treasury. The Tritanium-44 tokens are "mined" by the players building up a local cache of Tritanium-44 in their planetary Treasury and when they want, they can "cash out" all or a portion of that Tritanium-44 to on-chain Tritanium-44. Note, the reverse would be blocked. One cannot simply move on-chain Tritanium-44 back to the game. This prevents pay-to-win where players can purchase Tritanium-44 and push it back into the game. This may not be a sustainable model however since, what value would on-chain Tritanium-44 have without being usable in the game.
