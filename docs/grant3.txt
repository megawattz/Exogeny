Grant Proposal: ExoPlaneteer—Revolutionizing Casual Blockchain Gaming

Introduction: The Future of Exoplanetary Exploration Meets Blockchain

As we continue discovering thousands of exoplanets beyond our solar system, the fascination with distant worlds grows stronger. ExoPlaneteer is a blockchain-based game that taps into this curiosity, offering players the opportunity to govern their own exoplanets—from primitive civilizations to advanced spacefaring societies. The game provides a groundbreaking fusion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) within a casual gaming ecosystem, powered by Tritanium-44 (T44), the game's in-game cryptocurrency.

This proposal highlights why ExoPlaneteer is uniquely positioned to expand blockchain's reach and solve key challenges in both gaming and crypto spaces. We invite cryptocurrency organizations to fund this next-generation gaming ecosystem, which promises to bridge the gap between NFTs, gaming, and real-world crypto utility.

The Current Opportunity in Gaming and Cryptocurrency

Blockchain technology, particularly cryptocurrency, has struggled to gain real traction outside of niche DeFi applications. While cross-border payments and supply chain tracking have their use cases, these innovations have not captured the imagination of mainstream audiences.

However, gaming presents a multi-billion-dollar industry that cryptocurrency can enhance by legitimizing in-game asset ownership. Traditionally, players are wary of "pay-to-win" models, where real money leads to in-game advantages. ExoPlaneteer addresses these concerns by focusing on skill-based rewards rather than financial investment, making it an ideal entry point for casual gamers to experience cryptocurrency. Crypto games have struggled because they are competing with expertly written, and well financed and entrenched gaming establishment. We think this is because they are competing in an already saturated space of action shooter games. Exoplaneteer is a casual game, where the gaming aspect is secondary to the collecting and earning aspects. A non urgent, non-hectic, non combat based game where a person can proceed at their own pace and still be entertained. The audience would be mostly for people who do not have time to play games for extended periods, people who have jobs and people who have incomes and can afford to buy the NFTs.

ExoPlaneteer: Gameplay and Blockchain Integration

Game Mechanics

Players start by buying NFT-based exoplanets that represent unique worlds with distinct characteristics, including civilizations, resources, and environments. Through regular decision-making, players evolve their planets' societies and tech levels, earning Tritanium-44 (T44), a cryptocurrency that can be traded or reinvested in the game. In addition to "playing" the game, owners of the NFTs can display them with the built in screen saver we provide, providing a point of curiosity for guests to ask about the strange aliens and planets which might be displayed on a wall television etc.

NFT Ownership: Each exoplanet is a one-of-a-kind NFT generated through a complex combination of features. The planets are not generated using AI but the alien species images are.

In-Game Economy: T44 is an ERC-20 token earned solely through gameplay—there’s no “pay-to-win” shortcut. Players trade planets on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or use T44 for planetary upgrades.

Casual, Periodic Gameplay: The game is designed for individuals with busy lives, requiring only brief interactions throughout the day.

Market Opportunity

Game Asset Economy Standardization

Currently, players use underground third-party markets to trade in-game assets, often violating game terms. ExoPlaneteer leverages blockchain technology to offer legitimate, secure trading on decentralized platforms​(

Whale-Proof Economy Unlike many games where early adopters dominate the economy, ExoPlaneteer ensures active engagement is key to success. Players who neglect their planets will see reduced rewards, ensuring ongoing participation.

Real-World Crypto Integration The game's in-game cryptocurrency, T44, has real-world utility and can be traded on decentralized exchanges, providing players with a legitimate opportunity to monetize their efforts​(

Technological Integration
Tritanium-44 (T44): Players earn T44 through gameplay, not through financial investment. This cryptocurrency can be converted into other blockchain assets, increasing its real-world utility.
NFTs: Exoplanets are dynamic, evolving ERC-1155 NFTs, allowing for trading, upgrading, and market engagement across standard Ethereum-based platforms like OpenSea​(

Multi-Chain Support: While the initial release is on Ethereum, the game's architecture is adaptable to other blockchain ecosystems, such as Solana or Binance Smart Chain.
Grant Request and Roadmap
We seek funding to complete the following:

Development: Finalize the core gameplay mechanics, NFT planetary designs, and blockchain integration.
Marketing: Drive community growth within both the crypto space and sci-fi gaming communities, leveraging targeted campaigns.
Expansion Features:
Interplanetary Trade: Enhance the economy with real-time trade routes between planets.
Real Star Map Integration: Players can explore galaxies mapped from real star data.
Future Roadmap
Upgradable Planets: Players will be able to visually enhance their planets, along with improving stats.
Interplanetary Infrastructure: Additions like space stations and trade routes will create new layers of strategy.
Why Crypto Investors Should Support ExoPlaneteer
ExoPlaneteer represents a unique opportunity to bring real-world utility to cryptocurrency and NFTs within a fair and balanced gaming ecosystem. By funding this project, investors will be at the forefront of a revolution in casual gaming, showcasing the power of blockchain to a massive audience.

This is more than just a game—ExoPlaneteer offers a sustainable use case for NFTs and cryptocurrencies that can drive adoption beyond speculative trading. The time is right to support a project that merges entertainment with crypto innovation.
