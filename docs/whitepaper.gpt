Write a White Paper describing a new form of crypto token mining called 'Proof of Attention" which solves the low
entropy problem of most crypto tokens: low entropy in this context means large inequality of ownership. Which is harmful
to the eventual adoption and utility of a token.

Note: Throughout this paper, the item of interest will be called a token. The software of this industry, and the
industry itself has been misnamed and thus mischaracterized. It is not currency. It is not commodity. It is not
securities. It is tokens.

If it does not look like a duck, nor walk like duck, nor quack like a duck, then it's not a duck.

Quote brief explanations of the various current mining proofs and why they are flawed.

Proof of Attention requires a human being to actively pay attention to an app which every hour asks them to make a
decision and depending on how well they choose, greater or lesser crypto is added to their wallet.  By requiring a human
to make a decision, this prevents mining from being automated, so no matter how rich you are, you cannot be more than
one person. It also displays your private key and asks you to confirm it, so you cannot hire someone else(s) to do the
work without risk they will steal your wallet. You and only you can do this. Of course you can have multiple wallets but
you only get 5 minutes to respond to the mining question so how many wallets can you reasonably respond to.

The mechanism which isolates the mining to one real person is done through a simple game where a person owns a virtual planet
and must make decisions to advance the technology level of the planet forward. The higher the tech level, the more crypto tokens is 

The choice made is based on a game where the player is managing decisions about an entire planet's technological
evolution. 

Each hour, a question is presented to the planet owner (web page) which he must respond to, or the planet will fall
backward in tech level, and less crypto will be mined.

The questions are simple, but do require being understood, for example:

1. Your planet's people discover fire, do you prevent them from using it?
2. Your planet's people discover copper smelting, do you prevent them from doing it?
3. A revolutionary leader is disrupting your people's progress, do you help him?

Always answering yes, or always answering no will not cut it. You have to understand the question and respond with the
right answer to push your planet forward.
