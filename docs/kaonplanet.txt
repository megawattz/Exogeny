* Kaon Planet

* The virtual trillionaire idle pastime of  discovering, evolving and selling planets and their products.

* Kaon Planet is a game for people who don't have time to sit in front of a computer screen all day long, but like to
  engage in strategic games or pastimes.

* The game is actually 4 separate activities rolling into one:

** NFTs - Each planet in the game is an actual NFT on either Polygon, Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos or Solana blockchain.

** Animations - The Kaon Planets are not just static images that sit there. They are animations that are NFTs, but they
   can also be evolved and modified into additional NFTs as the owner add resources or plays the Kaon Planet game well

** Crytpo Tokens - Kaon Planets earn an actual Crypto Token called Tritanium44 which can be traded for any other ERC20
   token on the above blockchains. The amount of tokens each Kaon Planet collects each day is determined by:

*** The base earning of any Kaon Planet is 1 Kaon per hour.

*** The Tech Level of the planet which the player can raise by making the right moves in the game play

*** Collecting Kaon Planets that are all of a particular set. For example, if ALL of the planets of a solar system are
      collected, 1 thru 12, this doubles the Tritanium44 rewards for each of the planets over any other rewards
      multipliers. Collecting somewhat fewer than all the planets also increases reward

*** Having an entire set of each of the lifeforms doubles the rewards of the planets in that set.

*** Having an entire set of each of the life chemistries doubles the rewards of planets in that set.

*** Trading

   **** Recipes can be used to make refined or manufactured goods, which in turn can be used to make further refined or
        manufactured goods
	
   **** Goods can be traded with other players for Tritanium44
