Bugs that are not severe but annoying


1. Though there are 256,000 combinations of planet names, i.e. Star_Index Star_Name Planet_Index, like Pi Ganesha VI,
   there are still collisions. That's not good. Each planet in the end must have a unique name just for pride of
   ownership

2. Sometimes when generating or modifying a planet, the new version doesn't appear. You have to refresh again, or even
   again. This is because creating the planet doesn't happend instantly, even a single frame, so the UI waits for a few
   seconds before trying to fetch. Sometimes it's not long enough. Doing it multiple times is annoying because it ends
   up flashing the screen if the planet has already been fetched.

3. Can't get convert or povray to do more than 100 frames. It just creates empty images if you go above 100. This
   prevents clean orbits that don't restart suddenly. Every revolving part of the planet needs to revolve on a multiple
   of the other things so that when they restart their circuit, they restart exactly where they left off for a clean in
   infinite loop.
