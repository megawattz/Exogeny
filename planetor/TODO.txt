Website

* Main page would be nice to show one of the best planets but the time to load would be annoying. Maybe just a still or
  an MP4. I'd rather have a high resolution still than a low resolution animation.

* As the planet is spinning, type out text.

  * Want to run your own planet from primitive up to space civilization?

  * Be a Planeteer and evolve civilizations and destroy them if they displease you

  * Influence the evolution of species and discoveries of technologies to bring your civilization from the stone age, to
  the space age.

  * Planets are NFTs and earn the crypto currency Titanium-44 (show current exchange price) currency based on their
    technology level and resource availability

  * Your civilization can be gentle or savage, which one is better for earning

  * You own your planet forever, or you can sell it to another Planeteer.

  

* Available Domain names:
  planetdeity.*
  planetshepherd.*
  demigodz
    
* Website for users to purchase, upgrade, and interact with their planets. Must be mobile friendly also or have a
  mobile version. Screw native, just make it a website.

* Initial NFT Planet Creation will generate a planet. Then the user picks the things he wants to change and the planet
  is re-generated with the features the user wanted to change randomly something new, but the features he did not want
  changed, stay the same. This is a lot easier than letting the user select from huge menus of surfaces and clouds and
  atmospheres etc.

* Bidding war over planets

* Let users generate all the stills they want. They have to pay for the animated NFT.

* Have a page that shows still thumbnails of all the recent planets. When they click they get the animated version. We
  can let them choose one as the starting point for their NFT. I'll have to save the settings to a directory.

* Text explaining the NFTs and why they are valuable (not OUR thrill with them, but what normal users would care
about). I find it annoying when companies brag about "new version coming out". They are excited about that. I couldn't
give a rat's ass as it's usually more of a hassle than it's worth. You can announce new version, just don't make it
sound like it's a "feature".

Planetor

This project is crypto NFTs, with functionality.

The functionality is a game where the owner nurtures his planet to evolve life and a civilization.

For doing that he is rewarded with crypto tokens called Titanium-44

That's the very fundamental core of the idea.

I got the idea because I think it's very silly for people to be paying millions of dollars for JPEGs of bored ape
"colletibles" that can be replicated a million times a second by anyone. The only thing that you own by buying an NFT
like this is a unique ID for your copy of the picture that can be verified on the blockchain. Your copy is no different
than any of a million copies in its content. All you own is the right to say "I own the random number xyz123" (or
whatever the asset address is of the NFT). Frankly, it's one of the stupidest ideas I've ever heard of. However, the
concept of NFTs, if applied to unique assets like property, contracts, personal information etc. is the future of
commerce. So you've got one of the most ingenious ideas ever, balanced against one of the stupidest, held on a razor
edge by the ignorance of crypto-rich people who have too much money, easy come, easy go as they say. NFTs are God's way
of saying you have too much money for your IQ level.

Planetor is a convergence of multiple concepts

Crypto Tokens
NFTs
Digital Property
Digital Artwork (perty pichers)
Digital Pets
Space Games
Games for people who can't spend 80% of their time playing computer games.
Friendly, cooperative interaction with other planet owners

Working name Planeteer but this can't be the final name probably (trademark).

We need a permanent name before starting any marketing efforts

Here are some things that need doing

Animation

* Find lots of surfaces and clouds

* Fix up surfaces that don't blend well in 360 degree rotations

* Free-to use clouds and surface images. I just grabbed stuff off Google Images and many of these are copyright and we
  can't use them for a commercial game

* Tilted revolution of moons. Don't have the necessarily orbiting the ecliptic or equator of the planet

* The atmosphere needs to be hazier and trail off more gradually into space.

* Irregular chunk-of-rock moons using bump maps (captured asteroids)

* Better optimization of animated gifs because unless the moons can complete their orbits over one cycle of the gif, the
animation jerks when it starts over

* I'd be spending all my time tweaking planets if I could but this is just a prototype for now. 

* Let people upload their own image maps for surfaces and clouds

* Life form images, landscape images.

* Each feature of course costs a little bit more $$$. Like each moon costs something. Changing the Sun brightness or
  angle $$$ etc.

* Save the pov file (the text file which controls image generation) because we want to let the user modify his planet,
upgrade it and if he engages in PVP and loses, regenerate theplanet as a cracked up pile of rubble floating in
space. LOL!!! But of course, let the user add features like rings, or space stations or anything else we come up with
later when the planet tech level increases and user pays $$$

Crypto

* Smart contract for NFTs

* IPFS storage of NFTs

* Smart contract for Titanium-44, the reward crypto of advancing your planet

* Go client which mines Kaon while displaying your planets on your screen as a screen saver

NFTs

* Each planet should be numbered starting from 1 on up as the "collectors" index.

* Each planet name is unique and nobody else can own the same planet name

* Each planet is numbered from 1 and incrementing. The lower numbers have more value to collectors

* have a screen that shows the most recently generated planets (animated when user mouses over) that users can use to
  choose their initial template

Marketing

* Set up Twitter, Telegram, Twitch, Facebook, Discord channels

* See if we can weasel some Mediamath free advertising!!!!

Game Engine

* I want to market this game, as a game for people who don't have time to sit in front of a screen all day long. It's
something where they tweak parameters but the game continues to run without their involvement. There are enough games
for hard core gamers already. I am hoping this taps a demographic of people who have jobs and obligations but still like
to play games.

* Game engine that manipulates the planets metadata every hour, simulating a logarithmic time scale, that is, when the
planet is first created time moves fast and life evolves quickly but the closer it gets to high-tech (the highest tech
is whatever we haven't rendered game material for yet!)

* Generate idea planet owner, The Planeteer, is the God of that planet and has a lot of control over how fast it evolves
in tech level.

* Not all tech is material tech, psychic and spiritual tech can be evolved also. I have no concrete idea how any of this
will work during game play

* Generate idea is planet evolves higher tech etc but much slower as it approaches top tech level

* User spends funds to upgrade planet, tweak life forms, be a god that controls populations and rulers to hasten the
  tech level but too much pressure on the population results in revolutions which cause a regression in tech level.

* Natural disasters occur randomly and Planeteer must have population build defenses or counter-measures before they
  happen or else the civilization could be wiped down several tech levels.

* Tables of all sorts of parameters can be created and their interactions affect the evolution.

* Life form chemistry and form, solar system environment, natural resources available,

* PVP is optional. I'd like to favor more of a cooperative approach (trade) where natural resources are exchanged betwen
  planets to build more valuable finished goods etc.

* I'd hope the game mechanics foster alliances and other interaction amongst the players. Make it easy to "make deals"
  and set up automated trade routes.

* I don't want to be a crusader for games. This is a money making venture and needs to appeal to the largest audience
  possible. That is isn't a 1st person shooter, or other wood de woop game is only because of the resources available to
  create it. We don't have millions of dollars to pay a crew.

GAME

* stats
  material tech level
  non material tech level - some cultures may develop mind control to make other planets bend to their will, not just through physical force
  population
  happiness
  types of culture - anarchy, oligarchy, hive mind, AI etc.
  infrastructure
  resources
  trade
  manufacturing

* Deities can only communicate with their intelligent species through prophets, individual beings, they cannot actively
modify the material universe. They can impart knowledge to them but they will not be able to assimilate knowledge above
their next tech level. You must nurture them through each tech level with decimal points (electricity 3.0, fire 1.2,
metallurgy 3.6, industrial age 1.1, space age 4.3 etc) you can only feed them knowlege one decimal point higher. If you
feed too much knowledge to a prophet, the society will kill them. Prophets arrive randomly. You cannot create them. You
must take advantage of them when they arrive.

* Like digital pets? You have to keep your planet alive with active participation, or it will die.
