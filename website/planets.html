	<h2>The Planets of ExoPlaneteer</h2>

	<p class="section">
	Planets are the GNFTs, Game NFTS, (available at <a style="color: rgb(143,194,254);" target="_blank"
	href="https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/exoplanets-4">http://opensea.com</a>). <b><i>Owning planets
	generates Tritanium-44 crypto tokens hourly</i></b>.You can greatly increase that rate by advancing the planet's
	tech level and population. How this is done is by responding to opportunities presented every hour on your
	smartphone (or computer), that let you determine the development path of the planet, how it advances and how
	fast. The types of governments needed at specific times, which technologies to concentrate on, how much to spend
	salvaging disasters or investing in new technologies.
	<p class="section">
	  You can also increase the Tritanium-44 production rate by collecting sets of planets, for example
	</p>
	<ul class="section">
	  <li class="item"> A set composed of planets from each type of life form</li>
	  <li class="item"> All the planets of a particular star</li>
	  <li class="item"> A set composed of every type of planet</li>
	  <li class="item"> Evolving an entire solar system to the same type of civilization</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="section">Planets have characteristics which affect their evolution and Tritanium-44 production.</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Some things are intrinsic characteristics of a planet and cannot be changed (yet). These are planet_size,
	  planet_terrain, clouds, atmosphere, official name like "Alpha Centauri X", galactic catalog number, planet
	  index, moons, rings and a few other things.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Three things can be set immediately upon acquisition of a planet, or anytime the owner wants. These are:
	</p>
	  <ul class="section">
	    <li class="item">Common Name - Like "Earth" as opposed to official name "Alpha Sol III"</li>
	    <li class="item">Motto - Like, "The place where the rich come to enjoy themselves"</li>
	    <li class="item">Species Name - What your civilization calls itself like, "Grungoids" or "Promilian", whatever want.</li>
	  </ul>

	<h2>Characteristics</h2>
	
	<p class="section">These are aspects of the planet that cannot be changed</p>
	
        <p class="section"><span class="attribute">Galactic Catalog Id</span> - The unique identifier for this
        planet</p>
	
	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Planet Terrain/Geomorphology</span> - The type of planet, oceanic,
	gas giant, desert etc. Has a large effect on the events that occur to the planet, for example, desert planets
	cannot have tsunamis.</p>

        <p class="section"><span class="attribute">Atmospheric Composition</span> - This affects what types of events
        can occur on the planet.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Moons</span> - When a civilization unlocks space travel, moons can
	reveal new resources.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Official Name</span> - How the planet is referred to in game
	generated actions, for example our planet would officially be named <i>Alpha Sol III</i>. "The 3rd planet in the
	first (alpha) star of the Sol star system". There is also a "common name" which the owner of the planet can
	set. Our planet's common name is, "Earth", in the English language.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Dominant Indigenous Life Form</span> - This is the life form, the
	basic shape of the dominant species. It has a large effect on what the culture of the planet is capable of.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Life Chemistry</span> - Has a large effect on events that can occur
	to the planet.</p>

	<h2>Resources</h2>

	<p class="section">These are general categories of resources that are needed to create finished products for
	exchange with other planets. For example, the formula for "consumer products" might be 10 units of Industrials
	and 2 units of Specialized. The formula for a spaceship might be 20 units of Industrials, 1 unit of
	Radioactives, 1 unit of Refractories, 2 units of Specialized and Knowledge Level 2.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Industrials</span> - Abundant materials</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Rare Ores</span> - Generically rare materials.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Radioactives</span> - Naturally occuring radioactive materials needed
	to initiate nuclear reactions.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Refractories</span> - Materials able to operate at high temperatures
	and pressures.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Specialized</span> - Materials with unique properties for which there
	is no substitute.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Biologicals</span> - Life and byproducts of life.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Exotics</span> - Materials unique to the planet, think "Spice" of the
	Dune novels.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Relics</span> - Technological artifacts which are very, vary rare but
	can give your civilization a fast boost in tech level</p>

	<h2>Wealth</h2>

	<p class="section">These are the accumulated resources the population has created, not natural raw materials</p>

        <p class="section"><span class="attribute">Infrastructure</span> - The buildings, roads, bridges, power plants,
        real estate, universities, transportation grid. The physical build up of structure to enable high population and
        technology</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Manufactured</span> - Manufactured items such as tools, vehicles,
	pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, weapons, computers etc etc</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Services</span> - The services that the population can provide to
	other civilizations such as research, intellectual property, assistance, counseling, education, etc. The
	non-physical assets.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Entertainment</span> - Exported media, fiction and attention grabbing
	materials that other civilizations desire.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Population</span> - The number of living creatures of the dominant
	species. This is im	portant because the higher the population, the higher the Tritanium-44 production.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Tritanium-44</span> - The stockpile of Tritanium-44. The planetary
	reserves that have not been moved into a crypto wallet yet.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Knowledge</span> - The accumulated research and discoveries of the
	culture.</p>

	<p class="section"><span class="attribute">Woo</span> - The spiritual power of the culture. Intelligent life
	devoid of fingers and hands develops pure mental or PSI powers, which we will call "woo" for lack of a better
	word.</p>
