 	<h2>ExoPlaneteer Life Forms</h2>

	<div class="section">
	<p>Each planet has a dominant, indigenous life form. All lifeforms are equally intelligent however each has
	  peculiar, unique traits and abilities the others do not. Each life form population must also be managed in its
	  own way for maximum Tritanium-44 production and to avoid disaster.</p>

	    and the usage of their minds, and psi powers that would be considered magical by other life forms. Aquatics
	    can summon the living resources of an entire planet toward a common goal using their minds alone.</span></p>
