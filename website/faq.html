    <a id="#Overview">ExoPlaneteer Overview</a>
    <ul>
      <li>NFT game for busy people who cannot sit in front of screen all day
	<li>This is not the game for hard core gamers, it's for casual players who cannot, or do not want to, sit in
	front of a screen in all their free time. It's also probably 1/100th of the effort required for a full blown,
	immersion, space shooter. This is more like buying and managing fictional, galactic real estate.
      <li>Planets are NFTs
      <li>Planets acquire crypto token Titanium-44
      <li>Planets actively acquire crypto and can be interacted with for entertainment
      <li>Simple game for underserved market of consumers with disposable incomes who don't have time to sit in front of
	computer playing games all day long. This offers a diversion and entertainment without monopolizing ones time.
      <li>Working name ExoPlaneteer, another possibility is ExoPlaneteer (to capture recent interest in Exo Planets)
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
    <a id="#Points">What makes ExoPlaneteer different?</a>
    <ul>
      <li>ExoPlaneteer NFTs are animations, not just images.
      <li>ExoPlaneteer NFTs actually acquire crypto. They don't just sit there like Boring Apes
      <li>ExoPlaneteer NFTs can be improved and customized
      <li>ExoPlaneteer NFTs actively entertain and the player can feel a sense of ownership because of the work put into the planet
      <li>Simple, easy to learn.
      <li>Does not require full time participation to get rewarded
      <li>Big rewards possible, ongoing, not only at time of resale
      <li>Whale proof - Players must actively manage their planets or they lose technology, population and morale so
	there are only so many planets someone can own
      <li>NFTs and Titanium-44 are game tokens, not currency. This may have beneficial tax treatment in the future. Is
	the IRS going to tax Magic Swords and Fictional Alien Planets? Are pre-school gamers going to be required to
	file yearly tax forms?
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
    <a id="#Market">Market for Games</a>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are reading this, you already know that video games are a huge market.
      <li>ExoPlaneteer attempts to tap all of these hot, hot markets 1) video games 2) Crypto 3) NFTs 4) Sci Fi and Outer
      Space
      <li>Monetize latest fad of ExoPlanets discovered by space telescopes like James Web and Hubble
      <li>Engage players like "Sim Planet"
      <li>Urge to manage planets as if a digital pet like Tamagochi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi
      <li>Big rewards possible
      <li>Players can actively improve the value of their planets by developing them and evolving the civilizations on
	them
      <li>Whale proof - Players must actively manage their planets or they lose technology, population and morale so
	there are only so many planets someone can own
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
    <a id="#Play">Game Play</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Capture elements of simple games
      <li>Higher tech level, population and moral increase Titanium-44 production
      <li>Players can improve their planets by adding infrastructure like the all-time favorite game: Monopoly. Improved
      planets generate more Titanium-44.
      <li>Very simple, players allocate Titanium-44 (the game token) towards different areas of technology growth of the
      planet
      <li>Players can also collect sets of planets to increase Titanium-44 production like many card games (poker, gin rummy etc)
      <li>Elements of chance so the game is not overly dependent on a chess level intellect
      <li>Players allocate T44 towards tech or infrastructure, then at the top of the hour...
      <li>...the game calculates results, crediting crypto wallets with Titanium-44 and alerting players to significant
      events for their planet(s), by email or SMS if the player wants.
      <li>Random events happen which can negatively or positively affect planet Titanium-44 production
      <li>Initially P2E but PVP is coming as soon as play balance is achieved
      <li>Important to preserve simplicity for new players and never overwhelm them with too much game detail until they
	are ready
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
    <a id="#Crypto">Crypto</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Planets are NFTs and Titanium-44 is a crypto token: Two separate, but related things
      <li>ERC1155 NFTs and possibly Titanium-44 will use the same contract.
      <li>Planets are NFTs and can be purchased on OpenSea, Rarify, DEXes or ExoPlaneteer website.
      <li>Multiple blockchains supported: Ethereum, Binance, Polygon and AVAX an other EVM compatible chains
      <li>Titanium-44 is a simple crypto token that can be exchanged on DEXs or any exchange which wants to support it.
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
    <a id="#ComingSoon">Coming Soon</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Planets will be upgradable (for a price)
      <li>Rings - Like Saturn
      <li>Irregular planets and moons (chunky asteroid appearance)
      <li>Retrograde (backwards) orbits for moons
      <li>Dark side city lights (once a planet's tech level achieves electricity)
      <li>All cosmic object will be NFTs
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
    <a id="Planned">Planned</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Space Infrastructure like orbital rings, space stations, jhooks, space elevators, O'Neill cylinders etc.
      <li>Planetary resources will be fungible tokenized (Industrial metals, precious metals etc)
      <li>Asteroids and Comets
      <li>Star Map where actual stars are incorporated into the game in their proper galactic coordinates, and thus where
	a planet's location matters for interstellar trade and relative cosmic environment stability (some parts of the
	galaxy are more likely to experience cosmic impacts, supernovae, dust obscuring starlight etc., all mostly bad
	stuff)
      <li>Megastructures: Ring worlds, Dyson swarms, Stellasers, Stellar Engineering, Relocating Planets, Terraforming
      <li>Production of finished goods from raw materials (requires vigorous play testing)
      <li>See <a href="/about">About</a> for more information
    </ul>
