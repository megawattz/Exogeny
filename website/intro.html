	<h2>What is ExoPlaneteer?</h2>
	<p class="section"><i>ExoPlaneteer is the <b>casual</b> game of acquiring and developing planets in the galaxy,
	and gaining Tritanium-44 crypto tokens in the process.</i>
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  If you like computer games, but do not have time to sit in front of a computer screen playing all day long,
	  maybe ExoPlaneteer is the game for you: An idle pastime, and crypto token generator that will entertain you
	  and give you the sense of managing an entire planet (or multiple planets, there is no limit on how many you
	  can own)
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Planets are GNFTS (Game NFTs) that players own completely in their crypto token wallets. They can buy and
	  sell them on any compatible NFT marketplace.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Planets generate Tritanium-44 crypto tokens based upon their populations and tech levels. The higher each is,
	  the more Tritanium-44 that planet acquires for its owner. Your job is to manage the planet and increase the
	  tech level and population.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Gameplay consists of responding to events and opportunities presented on your smartphone (or computer) for
	  each planet, every hour. How you respond to those events will shape the evolution of your planet, and its
	  Tritanium-44 production. The goal is to raise your planet's tech level and population as high as possible. The
	  higher each are, the more Tritanium-44 you get. In essence you become the curator of the planet, the guiding
	  intelligence, the hidden hand that nudges technological development.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Every hour opportunities, challenges and trade negotiations with other players will be resolved. If a player
	  does not participate, the planet's tech level and population will decay bit by bit each hour, until the planet
	  reverts to its natural state of no Tritanium-44 production. Active participation is required to get Tritanium-44
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  This introduces a new paradigm in crypto token creation called <b><span style="color: dark-green;">Proof of
          Attention</span></b>, designed to defeat the uneven distribution of crypto tokens caused by whales buying up
          creating rigs to do industrial level creating of Bitcoin (for example). Tritanium-44 creating requires active
          participation by a person.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Tritanium-44 is the game currency required to respond to some events and add enhancements to your planet. It's
	  like the platinum, gold, copper etc. of MMORG games. <b><i>There is no expection or implied promise that the
	  planet or Tritanium-44 will gain value.</i></b>
