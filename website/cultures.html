	<b>Cultures</b>, or <b>civilizations</b>, are the main avenue of planetary development. It is the civilizations,
	and their evolutions that mostly determine the Tritanium-44 production level of a planet. Planets can change
	cultures and it is expected that, as tech level progresses, the cultures will change, even upon the same
	planet. Those changes can occur when opportunities present themselves and you, the guiding spirit of the planet,
	decide whether to support, or resist the change of culture that the planetary population is trending toward.

	<span class="hanging">
	  <b>Military</b> - Cultures run with strict hierarchies and devoted to the arts of aggression. Low creativity,
	  but highly productive with available means.
	</span>
      </p>

      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Religious.png"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Religious</b> - Run by dogma, realistic or not, and strictly enforced. Very low productivity of
	  Tritanium-44 but productive of strong Woo capabilities and resources and enables fast recovery from
	  disasters.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Hive.gif"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Hive</b> - Hive cultures are superbly organized, and every individual knows his purpose, place and
	  expendability without question. Low creativity and evolution, but superbly productive with available
	  means.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Selfless.png"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Selfless</b> - Composed of mostly individuals who put the quality of the collective above their personal
	  needs. These races have a moderate rate of development and are very good at survival with disaster recoveries
	  being fast and cheap.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Cooperative.gif"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Cooperative</b> - Cultures where individuals are cooperative but not to the exclusion of their personal
	  interests. Very creative and fast developing with a very good rate of production.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Adventurous.gif"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Adventurous</b> - Composed of intrepid individuals who care more for fresh experiences than concern for
	  their own survival. Superbly creative but even better at finding new resources and only moderately
	  productive. </span>
      </p>

      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Practical.png"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Practical</b> - Civilizations that place effective and practical
	  concerns above idealism. The most productive of all cultures, not hindered by dogma or idealogy.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p class="section"><img class="icon" src="image/Egalitarian.png"><span class="hanging">
	  <b>Egalitarian</b> - Individual rights and freedom are supported and
	  these cultures are largely accepting of the new, diverse and unusual providing that individual rights are
	  preserved. The most creative of all the cultures, fast development but prone to fragmentation, civil war and slow
	  recovery from disasters.</span>
