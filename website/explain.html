	<h2>What is ExoPlaneteer?</h2>
	<p class="section"><i>ExoPlaneteer is the <b>casual</b> game of acquiring and developing planets in the galaxy
	and acquireing Tritanium-44 crypto tokens in the process.</i>
	</p>
	<p class="section"><i><b>Exo</b></i> - Outside our Solar System</p>
	<p class="section"><i><b>Planet</b></i> - Large spheres of rock, liquid, gas or a combination that support life (in this game anyway)</p>
	<p class="section"><i><b>-eer</b></i> - Someone who does that thing</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Planets are GNFTS (Game NFTs) that players own completely in their crypto token wallets. They can buy and
	  sell them on any NFT marketplace that supports the Ethereum ERC1155 standard, and blockchains that
	  ExoPlaneteer supports.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Planets acquire Tritanium-44 crypto tokens based upon their populations and tech levels. The higher each is, the
	  more Tritanium-44 that planet acquires for its owner.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Gameplay consists of responding to events and opportunities presented on your smartphone (or computer) for
	  each planet, every hour. How you respond to those events will shape the evolution of your planet, and its
	  Tritanium-44 production. The goal is to raise your planet's tech level and population as high as possible. The
	  higher each are, the more Tritanium-44 goes into your crypto token wallet each hour.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  Every hour opportunities, challenges and trade negotiations with other players will be resolved. If a player
	  does not participate, the planet's tech level and population will decay bit by bit each hour, until the planet
	  reverts to its natural state. Active participation is required to acquire Tritanium-44
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  This introduces a new paradigm in crypto creating called <b><span style="color: red;">Proof of
          Attention</span></b>, designed to defeat the uneven distribution of crypto tokens caused by whales buying up
          creating rigs to do industrial level creating of Bitcoin (for example). Tritanium-44 creating requires active
          participation by a person. Sure, you could buy a lot of planets, but each one requires attention and there is
          a limit to what one person can do. If someone tries to automate participation, a disaster will result as the
          game engine inserts nasty surprises like asteroid impacts, plagues, earthquakes and pole shifts that will wipe
          their civilization back to square zero unless a human responds properly (easy to do) to the hourly prompts (or
          not at all). A human can respond easily and avoid such diasters, but a bot will not.
	</p>
	<p class="section">
	  If you like computer games, but do not have time to sit in front of a computer screen playing all day long,
	  maybe ExoPlaneteer is the game for you: An idle pastime, and crypto token generator that will entertain you
	  and expand your idea of what it takes to evolve a planet, or multiple planets because there is no limit on how
	  many you can own.
